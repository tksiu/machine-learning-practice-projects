        "This coding project would aim at demonstrating the experiences of doing one of the most common natural language processing (NLP) task, Text Summarization (TS), on the well-recognized public dataset sourced from 2,225 pieces of BBC News (availabel on Kaggle: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/pariza/bbc-news-summary\">https://www.kaggle.com/pariza/bbc-news-summary</a>) These news are usually within around 300 to 500 words, depending on the topics (e.g. shorter for business or entertainment news, while longer for political texts). The following three approaches were attempted respectively: <br>\n",

        "<li>Seq2Seq with Transformer (positional embeddings + multi-head attention)</li>\n",

        "There are two approaches on doing text summarization: Extractive Text Summarization (ETS) and Abstractive Text Sumarization (ATS). <br>\n",
        " <br>\n",
        "The extractive approach would be easier on the perspective of implementations, as the abstractive approach normally requires a huge number of training epochs and abundant samples to achieve results that are qualitatively satisfactory compared to human written summaries, and this would cost considerably large expenses on cloud resource acquisitions, which would be hardly affordable in small scale tasks. Moreover, as the summary texts in this dataset are basically extracting a portion of crucial sentences from the original full texts and reordering them. The unit of tokenization would be sentences in this scenario. Therefore, the notebook presents the follows conducting the extractive approach.  <br>\n",
        " <br>\n",
        "For the evaluation metrics, 1) accuracy represents whether the model could extract the correct key sentences and match the order of the delivered texts; 2) precision represents the propotion of all predicted sentences that are correctly extracted, i.e. the ability of the model in selecting the key contents; 3) recall represents the propotion of all sentences appeared in the summary that are also included in the predicted texts, i.e. the ability of the model in capturing or covering what should actually be present; 4) BLEU score borrowed from machine translation which indicates how well the generated summary could be compared to the actual summary after exlusion of the position tags marked padding, unknown, begin and end of sentences, and it could be treated as a modified score of precision.<br>\n",

The results deviated from the custom models in a greater extent, such that the average precision of the predicted summaries was enhanced to over 0.64 from 0.35, but the average recall dropped compared to the customized Transformer models.
